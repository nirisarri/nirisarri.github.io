*It is a fact: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) won*.  

Now, from the development standpoint this poses a nice problem, which is related to the toolset necessary to do development in an inherently distributed stack: Kubernetes assumes highly distributed applications, providing orchestration so the multi-server deployment is seamless and the obstacles of deploying distributed apps are minimized.

In my task to understand how this affects development, I am in a process to understand this technology and see how this will affect my system architecture and development strategies.

In an internal training I am taking in my company, the first task was to set up a [MiniKube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) environment. MiniKube is a minimal Kubernetes deployment that allows you to locally test and develop applications that later will be deployed to a Highly scalable environment.  The instructions focused on installing a windows native MiniKube; which installs a VM and manages it through the CLI. 

The recommended toolset includes installing all the prerequisites ([Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/), [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), [helm](https://helm.sh/)) in my bare-metal Windows 10 machine, and use the git bash console to run commands, as they are really similar to what you need to run in a Linux prod environment.  The problem I see with this is the fact that git bash is a pseudo-emulation that runs a subset of commands and has to jump through some hoops in order to run windows commands (related to the pseudo-emulation). 

My first idea to solve this issue was to use the wonderful WSL2 and install everything I needed inside it to be able to use a real bash in a real Linux environment. Unfortunately there are some [complications](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/5392) that are to be resolved by the Kubernetes team and are a show-stopper when installing MiniKube this way.

The available option is to use PowerShell instead of bash. I mean, it works, but you want to be as close as your deployment environment, right? this is what we try to do with containers and with WSL. So I found an alternative: Run a Linux VM in my windows 10 machine, and install everything there! also it has the added benefit of enclosing all in a single VM that I can turn on or off at will, and I can move away from my box or distribute along my dev team! 

There are a couple issues that need to be solved in order for this strategy to work, but as far as I can tell they are working and they are documented all over the place, so I will try to aggregate all the information and provide a nice recipe for creating a VM that runs Kubernetes via MiniKube.

## Overview

In order to have your instance running we need to perform  the following steps.  Some of these will be windows-only but others are platform independent: they can be performed on mac or windows hosts.

1. Ensure Hyper-V is running (windows Only)
2. Create an ubuntu VM
3. Install KVM2
4. install Kubectl
5. install minikube
6. configure minikube

Lets take a look at each part:

### Install Hyper-V on Windows 10

Reference the article [Install Hyper-V On Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v). 

As I mentioned before, the base platform I will be using is Microsoft's Hyper-V. You need windows 10 Enterprise, pro or Education in order to install and run Hyper-V. Of course you can do it on windows Server, but I will be focusing on Win10.

1. Ensure your BIOS has Virtualization enabled. This is different for every manufacturer. Check with yours.
2. Open a PowerShell console as administrator
3. Run the following Command:

```
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
```

4. When completed, reboot.

This should install the Hyper-V Manager console, where you can create virtual machines.

### Create an Ubuntu 18 Virtual Machine

I am still looking for a way to create it using powerShell, but here is the method using the Hyper-V Manager.

1. Download a .ISO for Ubuntu Server 18 from the [Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/download/server). at this time, the latest LTS (Long term support) version is 18.04.4 LTS
2. The Hyper-V manager, create an external virtual switch by

  - Click on Virtual Switch Manager
  - In _what type of virtual switch do you want to create_ Select **external** and click on **Create Virtual Switch**.
  - In **name** put something memorable, for example `minikube-external-switch`.
  - in **External Network** select an active external network card you want to use for your VM. 

> **NOTE:** This has an issue: lets say you select a wired adapter and you connect then on other place through wireless, then your VM will be disconnected. You have to keep this in mind, and adjust depending on your environment. If you have a better idea on how to be able to have internet connection and at the same time access to the internal ports of the VM from the host, please drop me a line ðŸ˜Š) 

â€‹	2. Back in the Hyper-V Manager click on **New â–¶ virtual Machine**.

3. Fill up a Name, for example `nic-minikube`, and change the VM's location, If you wish, in the **Name and location** section. This name is only to identify your VM in the Hyper-V Manager, and the location will depend on how you want to organize your VMS. The only recommendation is that the faster the hard drive, the better, so prefer an SSD to an HHD.

4. In **Specify Generation ** select **Generation 1** as it is more common and portable.

5. In Assign Memory, select 8192 MB (8 GB - I know: it is a guzzler.). Leave checked the **Use dynamic memory for this Virtual Machine** checkbox.

6. In **Configure Networking** choose the switch created in the step 2. In this example it was `minikube-external-switch`.
7. In **Connect virtual Hard Disk** select **Create a virtual hard disk** and leave the defaults.
8. In **Installation Options** select **Install an operating system from a bootable CD/DVD-ROM** and in **media** point to the ISO downloaded in the step 1.
9. Click on **Finish** to kick off the process.  Once it finishes, you will see the VM in your **Virtual Machines** list.
10. Select the VM from the Virtual Machines list and in Actions select under _<your vm name>_ â–² the **Settings...** button.
11. Select the Processor element under Hardware and change the **Number of virtual processors** to 4 and click **Ok** to save the changes.
12. Right-click on tour VM and select **Connect**. a black window should appear.
13. Click on the **Start** button in the middle of the screen to start the VM.
14. In the virtual screen select your OS language and press **Enter**.
15. Select **Install Ubuntu Server** and press **Enter**.
16.
